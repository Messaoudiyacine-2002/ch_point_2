             <section>With up to 600-hp under its hood, the 2022 Nissan GT-R is a powerful and tenacious-handling sports car that earns its nickname of Godzilla. Unfortunately, its formula hasn't changed much since it was introduced in 2009 but the sports cars it competes with have. Inside is where the GT-R's age becomes more apparent, with an outdated design and down-market materials that are shared with lesser Nissan models. The GT-R does have several things going for it though. For one thing, all-wheel drive is standard on every model which helps with handling and gives the car a planted, confident feel. Plus, it's more rare than a Porsche 911, so you'll stand out in traffic or at your next track day.</section>
